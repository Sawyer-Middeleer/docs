All browser automations are composed of four action types, built on [**Stagehand**](https://www.stagehand.dev) primitives. BrowseAI provides a simple natural language editor that allows you to build browser automation for any web app without code.

## Browser Actions

- `Go to a URL`: open a webpage at a specific URL
- `Check a condition`: validate a page state, such as whether certain elements are present or if the content matches expected values
- `Extract data`: get data from a page in a structured format
- `Take an action`: take a browser action, such as clicking a button, inputting text, scrolling a page, etc.
