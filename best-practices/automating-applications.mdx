Follow these best practices for best results building reliable browser automation flows.

## 1. Choose the right use cases

The most successful applications for BrowseAI are apps that do not already have robust open APIs, and do not employ bot blockers.

These use cases will typically fall into one of 5 categories

1. Legacy tools with no integration infrastructure
2. Platforms with highly customized workflows and data models (CRM, ERPs, etc)
3. platforms that restrict APIs for curated partner marketplaces
4. Startups that haven't built out integrations yet
5. Fully custom software solutions

<Note>
  We recommend against trying to automate consumer apps, such as social media
  sites. These tend to employ very sophisticated bot blockers.
</Note>

## 2. Break down automation flows into atomic steps

### Do this

Break flows into single-step actions

<Check>1. Take action: "open the accounts tab"</Check>

<Check>2. Take action: "select the account matching @input_account"</Check>

### Not this

Trying to do multiple things at once, or providing ambiguous instructions

<Danger>
  Take action: "open the accounts tab and select the right company name"
</Danger>

## 3. Keep credentials secure

Use BrowserAI's built-in [authentication](/features/authentication) management system. Do not enter private credentials directly into the flow configuration interface.

## 4. Test before deploying at scale

Run your flow with a range of inputs to make sure you have all of your edge cases covered before integrating into a fully automated sytem.
