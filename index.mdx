## Introduction

BrowseAI is a universal integration platform that enables AI agents to use any web app via direct UI automation. It lets you turn any series of browser actions into repeatable automations using a simple no-code interface. These automations are deployed as MCP/API tools complete with secure authentication and session management.

Automations built using BrowseAI are **repeatable**, **predictable** and **self-healing**. Anything is possible — as long as the action can be done within the interface of a web app, BrowseAI can turn it into a production-ready AI tool in minutes.

Additionally, the BrowseAI platform makes enterprise-quality authentication a breeze. We store all your credentials in a secure vault and can handle multi-step auth flows without manual intervention.

### The Problem of Missing Integrations

- Many legacy and custom applications do not have open APIs
- Application APIs lack critical functionality, making certain flows UI-only
- Developing production browser automations for agents is time consuming

### Where Other Browser Automations Fall Short

- **Agents are unpredictable**: fully agentic browser automation is too error prone to be trusted in a production environment, at scale.
- **Authentication barriers**: Each business application that an AI agent accesses requires auth management and security protocols.

## Where We Come In

BrowseAI uses browser automation to enable an integration-like connection between your AI system and any 3rd party application where traditional APIs are unavailable.

### Why Builders Choose BrowseAI

- **Ease of building** — Configure precise automations for any app using no-code. Turn automations into MCP tools or API endpoints with one click.
- **Managed authentication** — Give AI agents a trusted portal to auth into business applications. Store credentials in a secure vault.
- **Reliable performance** — Automations are deterministic and self-healing. You’ll get the same behavior and same outputs every time, even if the UI changes.
- **Optimized automation** — Workflows run fast at low cost. We manage browser sessions so you can focus on your product.

## Use Cases

BrowseAI creates tools for use by AI agents deployed in a variety of production applications, including industry-specific AI agents and general purpose agents.

- For **vertical** agent products - BrowserAI enables deep integration into every application that your customers use, mapping 1:1 to bespoke workflows.
- For **horizontal** agent products - BrowserAI gives your users a toolkit to extend your agent’s functionality to an unlimited set of apps.

**Legacy/custom application integration** — Define browser automation flows and make them accessible as AI tools: e.g. `get record`, `create or modify record`,

**Context enrichment** — Allow an AI system to access data from internal systems for use in decision-making or analysis tasks: e.g. `query record history`, `extract unstructured data`

**UI-only workflow automation** — Automate operational workflows in core applications where API endpoints are insufficient: e.g. `do [advanced action] with record`

**Dynamic scraping** — Repeatedly extract data from websites that require UI interactions, such as filtering, pagination, etc
